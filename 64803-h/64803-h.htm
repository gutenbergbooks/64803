<hr class="chap" />

<p>Ferris was in the tiny cupola, admiring the immense sphere of Earth
above him, when the bell sounded. Galsworth again, no doubt. It had
been Galsworth every time for twenty-four hours. What did he want now?</p>

<p>Ferris went below, preparing himself for the same ugly face, the usual
grating voice. He sat before the screens and snapped a switch. The
screen colored, took form. He was right.</p>

<p>Galsworth said: "Fuel Station 12?" As if he didn't know. When Ferris
nodded, the company head announced: "Replacement will be in effect
within ten hours. You'll prepare for the trip."</p>

<p>"Replacement!" Ferris gasped. "For what reason&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll have the details when you reach Earth, Ferris. Be ready when
Brooks arrives. He'll be there shortly."</p>

<p>"Brooks! Who's he? The kid?"</p>

<p>"You're asking too many questions, Ferris. Brooks is young, yes, but
he'll fill the position. We'll explain later. That's all."</p>

<p>It took a few minutes for Ferris to recover. Replacement! After six
years of service at the number one fuel station between the Earth
and Moon. Why, he was the only man who could handle Station 12! And
Galsworth was sending Brooks, a green kid barely out of SM school. What
was the guy thinking of?</p>

<p>Angered, Ferris got up from his stool and paced the floor. It was easy
to picture Galsworth sitting at his desk. He'd be chewing a big cigar,
pounding a pudgy fist into his palm, telling young Brooks that Station
12 needed a stalwart lad willing to face numerous cosmic dangers in
order that commerce between the Earth and Moon would not fall below its
present status. Only Galsworth would say it like that.</p>

<p>Well, what was wrong with the present status? Ferris had kept the
company heads above water; he hadn't fallen down on the job. But they
apparently weren't satisfied. Something was wrong, and it seemed that
Galsworth was taking it out on Ferris.</p>

<p>Still perplexed, Ferris entered his living quarters and began packing.
He dismissed Galsworth from his mind, wondered whether or not Brooks
could meet the task of operating the station. It was a lonely job,
sitting there in the cylindrical island of space, watching ships
approach and pass in the cold void that housed him. Brooks would grow
weary of it, just as Ferris had at first. There wasn't a more dismal
existence in the solar system, but to Ferris it was home, and even the
thought of that was comforting.</p>

<p>The sound of a hissing airlock brought Ferris to his senses. Brooks was
ahead of schedule&mdash;</p>

<p>Ferris went back to the control room. A tall fellow stood there, his
hair drooping, his space tunic ripped open at the collar. His face was
stone-like.</p>

<p>"You aren't Brooks," said Ferris. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Fuel," the other dropped a hand to a belt holster. "I need fuel for
my ship&mdash;a lot of it. And you're the only fellow in my path who's got
it. Let's not waste time."</p>

<p>"You've come to the wrong place," said Ferris, starting forward. "The
barrels here are under government combination seal, and can't be opened
by anyone other than the inspectors who accompany our regular ships."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," the tall fellow drew his beam gun, "you have fuel in
your repulsion tanks, and that's as good as any."</p>

<p>For a moment Ferris stood there, undetermined. Then he remembered a
police bulletin not so long ago. A convict had escaped from one of
Earth's interplanetary prisons. He understood now.</p>

<p>"You're Siegal," he said.</p>

<p>The other nodded. "My ship hasn't the fuel to carry me to the Moon. I
don't like to insist, but I'm going to drain your tanks."</p>

<p>"The station will fall," Ferris warned. "If the repulsion tanks are
drained, gravity will take hold."</p>

<p>"Unfortunate," said Siegal, "but it's me or the station. I've brought a
hose along&mdash;also a container. I'll give you the pleasure of filling it
for me. Hurry."</p>

<p>Ferris had no choice, so he did as directed. Siegal had the drop on
him, and it was best to play safe. Perhaps he could talk the fellow out
of his wild plan. There was a chance.</p>

<p>"Think you'll make it to the Moon?" queried Ferris as he loosened a
valve and inserted the hose. "It's a long trek for such a small amount
of fuel. Besides, you'll burn up half the stuff getting started.
There's no launch here, you know."</p>

<p>"I left Earth without a launch," said Siegal crisply. "I can do it
again."</p>

<p>The syphon began a steady flow.</p>

<p>"You won't make it," remarked Ferris. "And if you do get there, what
then? There's no place for you on the Moon. They'll track you down in a
few days."</p>

<p>Siegal laughed. "You seem quite certain of all this."</p>

<p>"Besides," went on Ferris, "I'll tell them all about you. They'll know
just where you are, and they'll be waiting for you when you reach the
Moon."</p>

<p>"Not if I destroy your radio," said Siegal, "and not if you ride the
station back to Earth."</p>

<p>For a long minute there was silence. The only sound was the trickling
of the liquid fuel. Ferris became uneasy.</p>

<p>"That's murder," he said at length.</p>

<p>"True," agreed Siegal. "That is murder, isn't it?"</p>

<p>The container was full. At the point of Siegal's gun, Ferris carried
the fuel to the airlock, where he was forced to don a space tunic and
transport the container to the lone ship that was anchored outside.
He made several trips, until the station's tanks were nearly empty.
Through vision screens, the glow of the repulsion jets could be seen,
receding gradually.</p>

<p>"The station will move in a matter of hours," said Ferris. "It's a
devilish trick, Siegal, and I hope they get you for it."</p>

<p>"Never mind. Just fill the container again. I want to be sure the tank
is empty."</p>

<p>Ferris set to work again. As he bent over the tanks, the floor gave a
sudden lurch and threw him against the wall. Siegal clutched a door
frame and steadied himself.</p>

<p>"No tricks, Ferris."</p>

<p>"But the station's moving. Can't you see?"</p>

<p>"Sooner than you expected. Perhaps you can tell me why."</p>

<p>"I don't know, Siegal. Something's happened."</p>

<p>"It's all right, finish your work."</p>

<p>Ferris complied. Once more the precious liquid trickled into the
container. Minutes passed.</p>

<p>"Brooks reporting, sir."</p>

<p>Siegal turned, astounded. The red-headed youngster stood there, a
look of bewilderment on his face. Then Ferris leaped, caught Siegal
about the hips and sent him sprawling over the station floor. But the
convict was elusive. He twisted free, somewhat dazed, and stood erect.
He fired a beam at Ferris, who rolled across the floor in pain. Brooks,
realization having dawned upon him, started forward. Siegal emitted a
shrill noise, grabbed the container and ran for the airlock. Brooks
blocked his way, and went down as the gun struck his skull. Siegal
leaped over him, vanishing a moment later beyond the airlock.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>His brain in a turmoil, Ferris got slowly to his feet and looked about.
The room was empty. No Siegal, no Brooks. The station was tilted at
an angle, swaying slightly. It was falling, due to the excess weight
applied when Brooks anchored his cruiser.</p>

<p>Ferris nursed his aching head. The beam had shaved his neck just below
the ear, breaking his space tunic's glass helmet, otherwise doing no
harm.</p>

<p>Ferris made his way to the airlock. Through the heavy glass he glimpsed
a portion of Siegal's ship. Quickly, a plan formed in his mind.</p>

<p>He removed a metal space suit from a locker, donned it and clumped
awkwardly up a stairway leading to the upper level. He crossed to a
second airlock, advanced through, and stepped lightly onto the top of
Siegal's ship. He dropped flat and crawled to the supply lock, through
which a ship's food bundles were loaded. He grasped the latch firmly,
and waited.</p>

<p>A minute later the little cruiser moved into space. Behind, Fuel
Station 12 continued its Earthward fall. Ferris watched it go, his
heart heavy. All his belongings went with Station 12, all the things he
had called his home for six long years. He wondered about Brooks. The
fellow's cruiser was drifting lifelessly to one side, no doubt having
been cut free by Siegal. There was no evidence of Brooks' whereabouts.</p>

<p>Ferris clung to the heavy latch as Siegal's cruiser slipped away in
space. Above and all around him hovered the vast outline of Earth, the
continents and oceans showing dimly through the deep shadows. To the
left was the Moon, drifting aimlessly along the great star-curtain.</p>

<p>Ferris tugged at the latch. It moved a little. He tugged again and it
sprang free. Ferris stood up, straddled the circular lock, and pulled
back the cover. Air rushed out. Through the narrow hole he saw the tiny
storage compartment. Satisfied, he let himself through and dropped to
the floor, pulling the cover back in place as he did so.</p>

<p>The room was small&mdash;only a few feet higher than Ferris, not much
longer. The sound of the oxygen pumps grew louder for a moment, as the
semi-vacuum was being replaced.</p>

<p>Ferris waited several minutes, then removed the space suit. Finding the
air suitable, he stepped to the compartment door, opened it a crack,
and peered out.</p>

<p>Steps led downward to a brief corridor. Beyond the corridor, a portion
of the control room was visible.</p>

<p>Ferris moved out, went down the steps and proceeded cautiously along
the corridor.</p>

<p>He put a hand to his forehead; a sudden dizziness swept through him.
He leaned against the wall, rubbing his eyes. There was blood on his
sleeve.</p>

<p>He couldn't remember how long he waited there; it may have been a
number of minutes. He could feel his sickness overcoming him. He was
weakening.</p>

<p>A footstep sounded, and Ferris tried to open his eyes. Then he turned
to go back, but a voice stopped him. It was Siegal's.</p>

<p>There was no use resisting. Siegal still had the drop on him. The
convict led him into the control cabin, forced him into a seat.</p>

<p>"You're a good man, Ferris," Siegal said, "but not good enough. I might
be able to use you, though&mdash;more or less as a shield when I get to the
Moon."</p>

<p>Somewhat revived, Ferris looked up. His head still hurt him, but he was
able to recollect his surroundings. He thought of Fuel Station 12&mdash;it
would be nearing Earth now. Soon it would strike, and then Galsworth
would be notified. Things would begin to happen.</p>

<p>"Brooks reporting."</p>

<p>Siegal swung, shouting angrily. But the youth was on him, knocking
the beam gun away, pinning him against the wall of the cabin. Ferris
watched dazedly, wondering where Brooks had come from. Nauseating
sensations swept him again, and things went black for a moment. He
heard Siegal's yells. A blow was struck, and Brooks tumbled back.</p>

<p>Ferris pushed himself from the stool and fell over the beam gun. As
Siegal bore Brooks to the floor, Ferris rolled over, brought up his arm
and pulled the trigger. His aim was bad, but the beam did its work.
Siegal simply went limp.</p>

<p>For a long minute Ferris lay there, looking up at the youthful form of
Brooks over him. He grinned.</p>

<p>"Good work, Brooks. You make a better stowaway than I do."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"This is the first time," said Galsworth, "I've ever seen bandages on
you, Ferris."</p>

<p>"I came to talk business, Galsworth. At least, you called me here for
that reason, didn't you?"</p>

<p>The company head placed a pudgy fist against his palm. "Of course. I
thought you'd like to know why you were called in from 12."</p>

<p>"Because you wanted to send Brooks there. Well, that's okay. He's a
good man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, not just that. We've a passenger pilot's license for you, if you
want it. Something we've been planning for some time. You're the only
one of our station operators who has passed the exams."</p>

<p>Ferris grew red in the face. "Then, all this was just a&mdash;promotion?"</p>

<p>Galsworth nodded. "When the new Station 12 is situated, Brooks will
take over. We've better things for you. Willing?"</p>

<p>To Ferris, it was overwhelming&mdash;more so than it had been aboard
Siegal's cruiser. He felt suddenly as if he would faint&mdash;the wound&mdash;</p>

<p>He did faint right there in Galsworth's office, but when he revived
Galsworth was still smiling. It was all right&mdash;after six years!</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
